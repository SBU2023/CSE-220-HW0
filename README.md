# Homework 0: Test GitHub Classroom Workflow
We will use this homework assignment to test the Github Classroom workflow that we will use to submit assignments in this course. This homework will not be graded. Use this opportunity to make sure that you have everything setup before working with the homework assignments. Do not hesitate to contact the teaching staff if you are stuck.

## Required Software
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\
Mac OSX and Linux systems have git pre-installed. Check by running the command `git --version` in a terminal. On Windows, you will use git bash to run git commands.

## Compilation
- You can use any framework that can compile C programs. However, I would recomend that you do it with [Codespaces] (https://github.com/features/codespaces). It gives you free 60 hrs of machine time each month. This will be enough for the programming assignments for this course.

### Autograding Example: C
This example project is written in C, and tested with make and bash scripts.

### The assignment
The tests are currently failing because we're printing the wrong string. Correcting the `printf` will fix the tests.

### Setup command
N/A

### Run command
`make test`

### Notes
- `gcc` can be used to compile and link C applications for use with existing test harnesses or C testing frameworks.
